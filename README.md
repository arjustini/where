A Ruby module that gives 'where' behavior to an array of hashes. This 'where' behavior allows an array of hashes to be filtered based on one or more conditions passed into the where function provided by the module.

Includes a file containing 5 tests that test the Where module in different circumstances (run tests.rb to see test results).
